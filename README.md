# Simple Font-size Controls
An Obsidian plugin which adds control over the font-size of the (Markdown/Live/Preview) Editor. What does it do? Well, you can increase/decrease the font-size from the editor (without changing the font-size of the whole Obsidian application).

From time to time I want to give my eyes some rest by increasing the font-size. But the standard controls increase the UI elements their size, which I find quite frustrating. I've set the hotkeys to `CMD=` and `CMD-` and it works like a charm.

# Simple Font-size Controls
An Obsidian plugin which adds control over the font-size of the (Markdown/Live/Preview) Editor. What does it do? Well, you can increase/decrease the font-size from the editor (without changing the font-size of the whole Obsidian application).

From time to time I want to give my eyes some rest by increasing the font-size. But the standard controls increase the UI elements their size, which I find quite frustrating. I've set the hotkeys to `CMD=` and `CMD-` and it works like a charm.

## Installation
Install **Simple font-size controls** from the Community Plugins in Obsidian. When installed (and enabled) you'll be able to setup your hotkeys and change the base font-size settings.

### (Optional) Install beta using [Obsidian42 - BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
1. Install BRAT from the Community Plugins in Obsidian.
2. Open the command palette and run the command BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing.
3. Paste this repo's link into the pop-up.
	a. `https://github.com/Maxymillion/simple-font-size-controls`.
4. Click on Add Plugin -- wait a few seconds and BRAT will tell you what is going on.
5. After BRAT confirms the installation, in Settings go to the **Community plugins ** tab.
6. Refresh the Community plugins list.
7. Enable the **Simple font-size controls** plugin.

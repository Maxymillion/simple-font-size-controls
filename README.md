# Simple Zoom

[![GitHub release (latest)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Maxymillion/simple-font-size-controls?style=flat-square&sort=semver)](https://github.com/Maxymillion/simple-font-size-controls/releases/latest)

An Obsidian plugin which adds more zoom control. What does it do? Well, you can increase/decrease the Editor's font-size (without changing the font-size of the whole Obsidian application/UI).

From time to time I want to give my eyes some rest by increasing the font-size. But the standard controls increase the UI elements their size, which I find quite frustrating. I've set the hotkeys to `CMD/CTRL` + `=` and `CMD/CTRL` + `-` and it works like a charm.

## Installation
Install **Simple font-size controls** from the Community Plugins in Obsidian. When installed (and enabled) you'll be able to setup your hotkeys and change the base font-size settings.

### (Optional) Install beta using [Obsidian42 - BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
1. Install BRAT from the Community Plugins in Obsidian.
2. Open the command palette and run the command BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing.
3. Paste this repo's link into the pop-up.
	a. `https://github.com/Maxymillion/simple-zoom`.
4. Click on Add Plugin -- wait a few seconds and BRAT will tell you what is going on.
5. After BRAT confirms the installation, in Settings go to the **Community plugins ** tab.
6. Refresh the Community plugins list.
7. Enable the **Simple font-size controls** plugin.
8. If you do find any bugs, please report them [here](https://github.com/Maxymillion/simple-zoom/issues).

## Integration
I've been using this plugin in combination with my [Zen (focus mode) plugin](https://github.com/Maxymillion/zen). It's amazing for my easily distracted brain.

## Credits
Based on the [Asana Sync](https://github.com/Maxymillion/asana-sync-plugin) codebase.
